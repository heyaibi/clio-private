# tmux session and window control for the phase driver.
#
# Sourced by scripts/phase-driver.sh. Not executable on its own. Expects the
# driver to have already set: SESSION, TMUX_WIDTH, TMUX_HEIGHT, REPO, RUN_DIR,
# LOG, and to run under `set -euo pipefail`.
#
# The model is one permanent session with two windows:
#
#   idle    created once, shows status. Never exits, so the session persists.
#   phase   created per launch, runs the phase. Closes itself when done.
#
# THE RULE THAT MATTERS: every command below names an explicit window target
# (`$SESSION:phase`, `$SESSION:idle`, or the session itself only for
# session-scoped options). tmux resolves a bare session name to that session's
# *current* window, which becomes ambiguous the moment a second window exists.
# A retargeted `send-keys` is the difference between Ctrl-C reaching a running
# agent and Ctrl-C reaching the log tail.
#
# Geometry: `new-window` has no -x/-y, so a new window inherits the session
# size. `window-size manual` holds the session at TMUX_WIDTH x TMUX_HEIGHT even
# when a smaller client attaches, which keeps the harness pty size stable
# (runner.py copies the pane size into each harness pty). `resize-window` sets a
# window explicitly and works on a non-active window.

# The two window names. A window whose command exits closes that window, so the
# phase window disappearing is the completion signal.
